echo An iqvw64e.sys file is already present on your system.
echo By overwriting this file (it exists in %systemroot%\system32\drivers)
echo there is a potential of blue-screens in PROSet and/or other tools
echo that already EXIST on the system.
echo *  If PROSet is installed, please uninstall PROSet and perform
echo    this setup again.  Please note, by re-installing PROSet later on,
echo    PROSet could render this tool useless and will require
echo    running install.bat again to make the tool work.
echo *  If PROSet not installed, this file could be used by another
echo    corresponding tool.  This may cause a blue-screen or failure in
echo    existing tools using the old iqvw64e.sys file, so you may want to
echo    rename the file for backup reasons.  If you want to overwrite
echo    iqvw64e.sys, please re-run the installation with a /y extension
echo    (install.bat /y).
