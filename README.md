# Intel-I210-network-card
This is a standard PCIe x1 Ethernet Card designed by KiCad.

Before you make it and want to use in your computer, remember to go to DOS system and flash config file to the card. The following steps maybe help.

1. Download [This folder](https://github.com/ssmiao/Intel-I210-network-card)  

2. Use Rufus to create a FreeDOS USB disk (RuFus support itself, you don't need to download a ISO file or something).
3. Copy my folder to the disk.
4. Shutdown the computer and insert the network card
5. Start the computer into FreeDOS system.
6. Go to /FARTHING and run AUTO.BAT

Good luck since I design it 1 year ago and can't remember it clearly. But the hardware can work.
