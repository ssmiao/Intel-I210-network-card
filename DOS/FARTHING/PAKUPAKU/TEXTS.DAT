Source Code (C) Jason M Knight and released to the public domain. If you are
going to give something away, lands sake just GIVE IT AWAY!!!. Don't give me
none of that dirty hippy "open source" nonsense! Here's a tip: If someone
starts running their mouth about "Freedom" and then weigh it down with a 35k
licensing agreement placing restrictions on what you can and cannot do with it
by way of loopholes in contract law and legalese nobody but a career lawyer
can decipher...

Well, does the term "snake oil" ring a bell?
